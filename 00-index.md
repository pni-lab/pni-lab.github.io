### About

The brain is the most complex system we have yet discovered in our universe. No wonder that studying it poses significant challenges. Recent advancements in AI and computational techniques hold the promise of tackling this complexity. These innovations may unlock novel - and perhaps unexpected - opportunities for integrating neuroscientific knowledge into clinical practice.

At the Predictive Neuroscience Lab (University Hospital Essen, Germany, PI: [Tamas Spisak](tamas-spisak)), we are a multidisciplinary team of neuroscientists, psychologists, physicians, engineers, and computer scientists dedicated to developing and applying AI/ML methods and computational models to address complex neuroscientific problems with direct translational and clinical implications.

We develop neuromarkers - biomarkers derived from neural data - that aim to predict behavioral and clinical states or traits at the individual level. We deploy computational brain models to uncover the neural mechanisms driving these predictions. We strive to apply these approaches in both experimental and clinical settings, directly evaluating their potential to enhance diagnosis, patient stratification, prognosis, and personalized intervention strategies for various brain disorders.
