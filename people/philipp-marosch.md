I am a Master's student in Behavioural Data Science at the University of Duisburg-Essen (Germany), learning about survey methodology, structural equation modeling, microsimulation and longitudinal analysis. As a research assistant, I am responsible for quality control using MRIQC. I am also completing my internship here, where I am exploring techniques and effects of sociodemographic stratification in the context of machine learning models.
